obs-streamdeck is a custom plugin for obs studio that allows to use the Elgato Streamdeck (v3.3.1) with OBS Studio (v0.22).
This plugin was done from a disassembly of the Elgato Streamdeck software, and then follows exactly the RPC protocol provided by the Streamdeck.

Unlike the official OBS plugin, this plugin enhances major functionalities and speed:

- Scene transition is not done anymore directly in the main screen when studio mode is activated.
- Hiding/Showing group hides/shows all the elements of the group.
- Enabling/Disabling filters.
- Enhances speed and memory handling.
